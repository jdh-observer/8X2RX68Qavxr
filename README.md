## Abstract

The rise of born-digital materials and the digitization of existing archives is fundamentally changing the nature of sources that humanities researchers work with. As sources transform to multimodal digital traces from which we look to extract data it becomes necessary to also reflect upon the digital environments within which we work. Building upon a decade’s work of digital humanities research and software development, we present Arvest: a tool for interpretative manipulation of digital traces based on IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework). After a comprehensive state of the art and establishing the theoretical framework that drives development, we shall present the technical specifications of Arvest, and how we intend it to simultaneously propose novel solutions to issues pertaining to working with digital traces and seamlessly integrate with existing tools. We shall also present a case study of research based on a multimodal corpus from the Horizon2020 COESO Project which drove Arvest’s initial development and illustrates some of its core functionalities.
